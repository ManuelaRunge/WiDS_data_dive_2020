## Major Question

Below is a table of number of incidents per neighborhood from 2015-2019 that the Chicago/Northern Illinois Red Cross responded to. There seems to be a few neighborhoods that have a lot of the incidents, those neighborhoods with over 150 incidents over the time period are shown in the simple bar chart. Our question is: **What is going on in these neighborhoods?**


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

red_cross<- read_rds("Redcross.rds")
top_neighborhoods<-red_cross %>% 
  group_by(primary_neighborhood) %>% 
  tally() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
top_neighborhoods %>% 
  filter(n > 100) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()


top_neighborhoods %>%
  filter(n > 150) %>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(primary_neighborhood, -n), n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("Neighborhood") +
  ylab("Incidents Responded to (2015-2019)") + 
  ggtitle("Incident Counts Per Neighborhood")



```

**NOTE**: This is not a question that we or the Red Cross definitively know the answer to. Feel free to be as creative as time allows!


## Minor Question
With the first question looking into where these incidents are occuring, another questions the Red Cross is asking is **when these incidents are occuring?** Look at seasonality of the dataset at a monthly, weekly, and/or daily level.
